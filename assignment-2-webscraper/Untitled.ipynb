    "I would like to be able to apply data science to the field of environmental studies. While there is much existing research on global topics such as global warming, Carbon Dioxide levels, etc., I believe that there is a lack of analysis on more local topics which could potentially spread awareness within local communities and incentivize them to take action. For example, many people can feel worried about global warming, but as it does not only impact their local community, i.e. the whole world is suffering from it, a bystander effect occurs wherein individuals and local communities remain passive and unmotivated towards initiatives in protecting the environment. \n",

It would also provide more conrete goals that can be achieved in terms of sustainability efforts.\n",

    "<b>Analysis:</b> From the graphs below, we see that the monthly ridership distribution for subscribers and customers, and the monthly subcriber to customer ridership ratio is roughly similar between all 3 states. As such, the analysis will be carried out in a generalized manner assumed to be sufficient for providing a high-level analysis of monthly riderships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>monthly subscriber ridership</b> appears to peak around June to October, with relatively balanced tails on either side.

    "The <b>monthly customer ridership</b> appears to peak around July to September, with relatively balanced tails on either side. The lowest subscriber ridership count is around November to February. The tails are much lighter compared to the subscriber ridership distribution, which indicates that the difference in ridership between months is greater for customers vs subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>monthly subscriber to customer ridership ratio</b> peaks at December to February, and hits relatively low points throughout March to September, with the lowest points being around June to August. This indicates that the number of susbcribers using the bike-sharing service around December to February are much higher compared to the number of customers, whereas the number of subscribers and customers using the bike-sharing service around March to September are relatively similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Recommendations:</b> From this analysis, we suggest that bike-sharing companies increase the number of bikes available around June to October to account for the higher number of riders. Bikes can be brought in for maintanence during December to February since ridership is relatively low then. As it appears that a relatively low amount of customers use the bike-sharing service from December to February, further research can be conducted to investigate the reasons for low customer ridership during these months, and high subscriber ridership during these months. If there is a correlation between low customer usage and high subscriber usage, this could potentially indicate that there are not enough bikes available to fit the cumulative subscriber and customer demand during the peak months."
